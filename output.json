What a journey it's been - and not the fun kind. Imagine trusting Bhavin Batt and Kiran Jadav, the big names at IndiaNIC, only to end up with a website that's as functional as a chocolate teapot.\n\nPromised a smooth ride and a project wrapped up in 6-12 months, I ended up on a never-ending carousel ride for over two years. And the prize? A website so broken, it's practically a digital wasteland. Every penny of the \u00a313,000 development cost and the extra \u00a33,000 on AWS servers felt like money tossed into a black hole.\n\nI've got a treasure trove of chat histories and recordings that paint the real picture of what went down. It's like a saga of broken promises and shrugged shoulders when I asked for a refund or even just a path forward. They claimed they delivered; I say they delivered a mess.\n\nAfter a grueling three years and jumping ship to another platform, I finally got what I was promised by someone else. So, what's the moral of the story? Run. Run far away from IndiaNIC and don't look back.\n\nIf you're on the hunt for a tech partner, my advice is to do your homework. Don't get dazzled by smooth talkers or fancy portfolios. Demand the real deal - proof of their successes, straight talk from past clients, and clear accountability.\n\nI'm laying it all out here - not just to vent, but to hopefully save some of you from making the same mistake. If you're curious or even a bit skeptical about my story, I'm here with receipts. Chat logs, recordings - you name it. I'm an open book if it means helping someone else avoid this tech partnership pitfall.",

Despite clearly outlining the scope of work, they consistently failed to deliver on their promises.

Despite being the paying client, I found myself constantly on the defensive, with Net Solutions refusing to acknowledge their shortcomings.\n\nNot only did they fail to rectify the issues, but they also refused to provide a refund for their subpar services. It's clear that customer satisfaction and integrity are not priorities for Net Solutions.\n\nSave yourself the headache and avoid Net Solutions at all costs. Their inability to deliver on their promises and their unwillingness to take responsibility for their mistakes make them a poor choice for any project.\n\nInstead of reaching out to me directly to address the issues raised in my review, they decided to post false claims, trying to shift the blame onto us, the customer. This is exactly what they do\u2014avoid taking responsibility and instead place the blame on the client. They do not hold themselves accountable for their own failures.\n\nIf you have a project that requires experienced, senior-level resources, stay far away from this company. They will mislead you, claiming they can handle it, only to fail in the end, and then accuse you, the customer, of causing the problems.

Our Project Manager Manish was able to instantly understand our goals and timeline and easily communicate what would be necessary from everyone to achieve our targets. His clarity and speed in creating excellent communication across disparate tech understandings and time zones was awesome. Our developer Pradeep was able to generate fixes so quickly and expertly, we were rapidly able to move out of repair mode to request complex improvements we'd been considering for years. Pradeep managed to implement new features like it was all incredibly simple, and took independent leaps in logic that improved on the implementation our requests, adding elegance in design and simplicity of use. Both Manish and Pradeep were intuitive and generous win their abilities, treating our software and team like it was their own business and not simply a contract. The entire Kays Harbor Team is imaginative, collaborative, wildly efficient, and just made for fantastic co-workers. Highest possible recommendation.",

We paid \u20b931,000 per person for 3 travelers[excluding flight], including a child. The package promised private travel and cabs, which initially made us excited about a pleasant vacation.\n\nHowever, as I write this review, I\u2019ve realized the recurring cycle of disappointment with MMT:\n\nConvincing Tactics: They first persuade customers to opt for a private, 4-star package.\nFull Payment Requirement: Customers are forced to pay the full amount at least a month before the trip starts.\nSubpar Services: Despite the premium promise, we were left with cheap services and accommodations that deviated from the voucher.\nLack of Support: No issues were addressed by the ground support team, tour manager, or MMT representatives, even after multiple escalations and SOS calls during the trip.\nPost-trip Compensation: At the journey\u2019s end, MMT offers a token apology, admitting they didn\u2019t deliver the promised services.\nAs a Platinum member, I can attest that this cycle is a common experience for many MMT customers. I strongly recommend considering other travel agencies that offer far superior services at half the price.\n\nMMT seems to lack control over their ground support, as everything is subcontracted\u2014car rentals included\u2014resulting in no single point of accountability.",

They have no clue on the JD vs Skillsets required - It shows how disorganized the organization is.\n\nAfter a week, I got a call from the HR again 'rearranging' the interview. The interviewer was asking meaning less questions on Supply Chain, Procurement etc. Why would you waste time asking some MBA\/Academic questions to  mid senior level candidate ? I understand the basics are important but this was sheer waste of time. Is my experience important or some textbook knowledge?\n\nI did a background on this organization. Most of the employees are from Russia, Ukraine, Georgia etc. They have a use and throw policy  - Once the project is over, you will be terminated. (Unstable career path)  And in the era when organizations are compelling employees to work from office, they are only offering remote, cheap work from home jobs.  I got rejected but I would not have taken the job anyways.\n\nPlease check with the Linkedin Epam employees - I have also read that they 'make' you write good reviews online while joining.",

After clearing the initial interview round, I was encouraged by their team to take an early release from my current job, with the assurance that my selection was nearly certain, pending a few additional rounds. Trusting their confidence in me, I took the early release.\n\nFollowing two rounds with their senior team, I was scheduled for a client interview, during which I was rejected with the feedback that I lacked experience and knowledge. This was shocking, as the feedback was inconsistent with my previous interviews, and it contradicted the confidence they initially showed in me.\n\nAfter losing my job and being left in a precarious situation, the HR team scheduled me for another project. Once again, I cleared their internal technical rounds, only to be rejected by the client with similar feedback. This has left me feeling frustrated and misled.\n\nIf I truly lacked the skills or experience, it begs the question: why was I pushed to leave my previous job and subjected to multiple rounds, only to be rejected at the final stage? The entire process felt unprofessional and left me jobless due to their mismanagement.\n\nAdvice : Please ensure a more transparent and considerate hiring process. Candidates' careers and livelihoods are at stake, and the decisions made by your hiring team have real consequences. If a candidate is not a fit, it should be identified early in the process, and not after they've taken life-altering steps based on your advice.",

They say 9hr 30 mins shift but you need to make sure you login 1hr prior your shift start (even for WFH employees) and sit for 3hrs (additional) post shift most of the day if the whole team didn't achieve the target together. If we didn't will to sit post shift, our TL threatened us stating he'll make sure we lose our job. But  you get paid for 9hrs 30 mins only. If you're in need of urgent holiday, you won't get it. Reason - BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS. But the fact is many employees bare resigning. Great incentive amount and salary but unachievable targets. I'll share my personal experience regarding salary. On March 2021 I hit a huge incentive amount. On the end of the month of September, I received salary with 4k deduction. On checking with my TL, he said the organisation paid me 4k extra in March incentive by mistake so they deducted it this month. During my FNF they tried to deduct the same amount of 4k again until I got it rectified. Do y'all even keep any updates on what y'all do?? The new HR is a complete idiot. I consulted her regarding issues at this organisation. All i got to hear is robotic responses. All she spoke is about professionalism and my work performance. When i told her that the music played at workplace is unprofessional, she said such songs are completely fine at workplace. Seriously! Naach Meri Raani and Munni Badnaam songs are okay to be played at workplace? Why don't y'all get bartenders and bar dancers at workplace? I informed about me being bullied at workplace, but she said that's how friends be. But I didn't knew those employees but its okay for them to bully me during work? Leave that, the desktop they provide are of ancient period it seems. System issues all the time. In 8 months of WFH i had to replace my system 5 times. I wanted to replace it the 6th time as well but my TL was not willing to help me and forced me to work on the technically broken desktop. I had to travel to and fro from Ola for system replacement as the system were too heavy. But this company didn't care about reimbursing or even arranging pick up & drop. I have lot more to say about this organisation but Google Reviews have word limit or else I would have posted a novel here itself.",

        "text": "They should be given zero\u2026even zero is valuable they should be given -1000\u2026 guys dont ever join tech mahindra. Worst nightmare and anand mahindra doesnt even care beside tweeting in twitter\u2026.I am writing this to let you know that I am filing an official complaint against the aasurant management that they are the worst management i have ever seen and they dont have courage to talk to me for anything. Ask anyone if they have talked to me before this decision. Now what they will do is take revenge and stop my relieving letter. If they have courage to talk to an employee i will come to office and see if they can talk how they harrasing the people there in the assurant. They have not given me exception on my behavior. Ask feedback about the management there from anyone working there. These guys should be terminated too. Mayank, gaurav, yatin , priya, amarjeet, pankaj no one came forward to talk to me. They all should be terminated. The manager should tell me about rhe smooth exit but they dont have courage to talk. Only thihg they say is talk to HR.  I will quote everything in social media too so that they get exposed. I cant use abusive words here. I will come to office and if they have courage come and talk to me and see how much empathy u have. They  dont know nothing. So much experience but dont know anything about work and ethics. I want compensation for this month too or I will file a court case agaisnt the management. I have all the proofs. All phone call records and mails and everything. I will drag each one of you. All i was searching was empathy and they have nothing. When I asked for leaves due to liver issue they didnt give it instead wasted my time and was that a big thing i was asking i have given the medical and all and they were like aliens that they dont know how to handle it. Even after their medical team approved it yatin said that i cant give leaves. Who is he to decide? All i was asking for day shift for 2 weeks only and their legs shaken. And they talk about my behavior. I am writing this each and every person should read it whole otherwise u will miss the purpose. After that when i start joining all i was asking for some refresher and wht they do is given 1 week training and says there is a certification. The certification which they had taken earlier was a joke.. every person cheated and passed. So in my case they take certification like I am giving upsc exam. I cleared first one technically because pankaj didnt checked properly the exam. And when I raised it, and find some answers are correct he said ok i am allowing u to get into production. Then suddenly after 2 days mayank says give test again. There is no cooperation between them. In second and thirdd test amarjeet make sure to make me fail as she made the question which even the people in production dont get the cases. She is also the culprit. I didnt clear the test so they will not talk to me after that. Wht kind of people they are? Yatin and priya dont know anything. I dont know why they are team leaders. I thought priya is good but she says one thing to you and then says some other thing. Earlier she says that raise complaint against HR charajit and next day she said charajit is good. They could have make my exit smooth but what they are doing is nothing. They are pure evil. I didnt get salary for my previous month just because the team lead yatin dont know wht to talk to HR and they both blame each other for NCNS. I am adding all the conversations here. Check everything. I will not leave u all like this. I will fight the legal aid against u all and make sure you get exposed to every platform. Mayank shrivastava, Gaurav sachdeva, yatin chaabra, priya, amarjeet, pankaj and alll are culprits. I will file a complaint against you all according to labour laws. You alll are pure evils.",

Waited without any dilemma for we all ''shortlisted candidates\" assumed we are getting the offer letter. The DRAMA starts at the end of the 2nd week of March when we didn't get the offer letter as we were told. Then after much deliberate push from the so called shortlisted candidates, an HR named Himanshu was force to call all the shortlisted candidates to give assurance that due to storm in US the release of the offer letter has been postponded and we will only be getting it after 20th March 2018 and probably the joining will be by the end of March 2018. I believe all the short listed candidates with no complaints agreed to wait until then. In the last week of March 2018 we were again infomred that the issues hasn't fix so we will have to wait till mid April 2018 and we will get the offer letter. Now its mid April and this very organisation has started hiring for the same process all over again not considering the shortlisted candidates they kept in hold for the last two months without any pay. The time and energy we lost during the false hope they had given us has made me conclude that this organisation doesnt follow any corporate ethics. I will never suggest this low grade organisation to anyone for they are not worthy of anyone's time for they take the helpless candidates for GRANTED!",

If GG-5 is not your base location and you have booked 2office there then also you won't be given access to work, no access to wifi or charging ports. Also the reception staff was a bit rude and few other staff were quite unprofessional. I went there for Id card printing and had to wait for it for over 5 hours cause their machines weren't functional. The cafeteria sucked but there is a dhaba(smoking spot) nearby and also there is a huge crunch at the parking lot. GG-7 is much better than GG-5 in terms of facilities.",
